## Introduction

Nike and Adidas are two large companies in the footwear Industry. While keeping excellence in products over years, both companies have extended their markets by adding exclusive lines like Jordans, Air Max, NMD, Yeezy, and more. Even though both companies will consider current market conditions in setting its price points and price ranges of shoes, customers are unaware if the companies utilize the value-based pricing strategy which considers the consumers’ willingness to pay or premium pricing strategy which is based on quality and value of products. Many factors can alter customers’ willingness to pay for the company’s products, but our analysis will focus on the display of the products on the company's website such as wording, colors, and more. From this analysis, we want to extend our market research practice and ultimately predict the price of a shoe using the name of products, number of styles, and other indicators.
